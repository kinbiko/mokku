## PRs

If you wish to contribute a change to this project, please create an issue first to discuss.
If you do not raise an issue before submitting a (significant) PR then your PR may be dismissed without much consideration.

PRs only improving the documentation are welcome without raising an issue first.

Ensure that:

1. The tests pass.
1. The linter has 0 issues.
1. You don't introduce any new dependencies (ask in an issue if you feel strongly that it's necessary).
1. You follow the existing commit message convention.
